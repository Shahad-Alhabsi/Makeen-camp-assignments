1) a certain steel is graded according to the following conditions:
    i.Rockwell hardness > 50 
    ii.Carbon content > 0.7 
    iii.Tensile strength > 5600 kg/cm2 
The steel is graded as follows: 
    a. Grade 10, if all the conditions are satisfied 
    b. Grade 9, if conditions (i) and (ii) are satisfied 
    c. Grade 8, if conditions (ii) and (iii) are satisfied 
    d. Grade 7, if conditions (i) and (iii) are satisfied 
    e. Grade 0, otherwise
Draw the flow chart and algorithm steps to solve this problem
